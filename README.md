# BamTwoogle dataset

This repository contains the BamTwoogle dataset for the paper [ReST meets ReAct: Self-Improvement for Multi-Step Reasoning LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10003).

## Overview

BamTwoogle is a small (100 questions in total), handcrafted collection of information-seeking questions. It was written to be a complementary, slightly more challenging sequel to [Bamboogle](https://github.com/ofirpress/self-ask/blob/main/datasets/bamboogle.md) dataset.

## Dataset Description

The topics and question formats vary, but in general, BamTwoogle adheres to the following guidelines.

### Questions
- The majority of questions require two searches or reasoning steps (like Bamboogle), but some of them need 3 or 4.
- Must have been manually checked to ensure the answer doesnâ€™t appear on the first page of Google search results.

### Expected answers
- Should not be ambiguous.
- Should not be prone to change over time, either due to the phrasing of the question or to the nature of the answer.
- Should account for multiple versions of proper names, etc., where appropriate.
- Should prefer Wikipedia as the source of truth for facts (preference given to topics/articles not flagged for incompleteness, lack of sources, etc.)
